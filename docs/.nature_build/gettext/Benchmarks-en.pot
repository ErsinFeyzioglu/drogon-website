We only do an HttpSimpleController and register it on the */benchmark* path. The controller returns *<p>Hello, world!</p>* for any request. Set the number of drogon threads to 16. The processing function is as follows and you can find the source code at the *drogon/examples/benchmark* path:"

This score is quite good. In the case that each request initiates a connection, CPU time will be spent on TCP connection establishment and disconnection, and the throughput will drop to 140,000 requests per second, which is reasonable."
