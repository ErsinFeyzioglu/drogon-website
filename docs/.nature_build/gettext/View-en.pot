msgid "Although the front-end rendering technology is popular, the back-end application service only needs to return the corresponding data to the front-end. However, a good web framework should provide back-end rendering technology, so that the server program can dynamically generate HTML pages. Views can help users generate these pages. As the name implies, it is only responsible for doing the work related to the presentation, and the complex business logic should be handed over to the controller."

msgid "The earliest web applications embed HTML into the program code to achieve the purpose of dynamically generating HTML pages, but this is inefficient, not intuitive, and so on. So there are languages such as JSP, which are the opposite. , embed the program code into the HTML page. The drogon is of course the latter solution. However, it is obvious that since C++ is compiled and executed, we need to convert the page embedded in C++ code into a C++ source program to compile into the application. Therefore, drogon defines its own specialized CSP (C++ Server Pages) description language, using the command line tool drogon_ctl to convert CSP files into C++ source files for compilation."

msgid "The interface is a member method of *HttpAppFramework*, and the parameter is an array of strings representing a list of directories in which the view csp file is located. After calling this interface, drogon will automatically search for csp files in these directories. After discovering new or modified csp files, the source files will be automatically generated, compiled into dynamic library files and loaded into the application. The application process does not need to be restarted. Users can experiment on their own and observe the page changes caused by the modification of csp file."

#: ../../source/View-en.rstd:161
msgid "Note: This feature is best used to adjust the HTML page during the development phase. In the production environment, it is recommended to compile the csp file directly into the target file. This is mainly for security and stability."
