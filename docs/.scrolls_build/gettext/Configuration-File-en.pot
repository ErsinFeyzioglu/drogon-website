msgid "You can control various behaviors of the Http server by configuring various parameters through multiple interfaces of the DrogonAppFramework instance. However, using a configuration file is a better way for the following reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Configuration-File-en.rstd:7
msgid "Using a configuration file instead of source code can determine the behavior of the application at runtime rather than at compile time, which is undoubtedly a more convenient and flexible way;"

#: ../../source/Configuration-File-en.rstd:12

If you use the drogon_ctl create project command to create a project, you can also find the file config.json with the same content in the project directory. So, you basically don't need to create a new configuration file but make some changes to this file to complete the configuration of the web application."
