msgid "In HttpController's example, the getInfo method should check whether the user is logged in before returning the user's information. We can write this logic in the getInfo method, but obviously, checking the user's login membership is general logic which will be used by many interfaces, it should be extracted separately and configured before calling handler, which is what filters do. After the drogon framework completes the URL path matching, it first calls the filters registered on the path in turn, and only when all the filters allow \"pass\", the corresponding handler will be called;"

msgid "Of course, users can customize the filter, you need to inherit the HttpFilter class template, the template type is the subclass type, for example, if you want to create a LoginFilter, you could define it as follows:"

#: ../../source/Filter-en.rstd:48
msgid "The registration of filters is always accompanied by the registration of controllers.the macros (PATH_ADD, METHOD_ADD, etc.) mentioned earlier can add the name of one or more filters at the end; for example, we change the registration line of the previous *getInfo* method to the following form:"

msgid "As you can see, the configuration and registration of filters are very simple. The controller source file that registers filters does not need to include the filter's header file. The filter and controller are fully decoupled."
