msgid "The route (or called mapping) from the URL path to the handler is done by a macro. You could add multipath mappings with the *PATH_ADD* macro. All *PATH_ADD* statements should be set between the *PATH_LIST_BEGIN* and *PATH_LIST_END* macro statements."

msgid "The first parameter is the path to be map, parameters behind the path are constraints on this path. Currently, two types of constraints are supported. One is the *HttpMethod* enum Type, which means the Http method allowed. The other type is the name of the *HttpFilter* class. One can configure any number of these two types of constraints and there are no order requirements for them. For Filter, please refer to Filter."

msgid "**The mapping from the above path to the handler is done at compile time. In fact, the drogon framework also provides an interface for runtime completion mapping. The runtime mapping allows the user to map or modify the mapping through configuration files or other user interfaces without Recompile this program (For performance reasons, it is forbidden to add any controller mapping after running app().run() method).**"
