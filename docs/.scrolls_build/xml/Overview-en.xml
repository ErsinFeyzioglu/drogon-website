        <title>Overview</title>
        <paragraph><emphasis>Drogon</emphasis> is a C++14/17-based HTTP application framework. Drogon can be used to easily build various types of web application server programs using C++.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><emphasis>Drogon</emphasis> is the name of a dragon in the American TV series “Game of Thrones” that I really like.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Drogon’s main application platform is Linux. It also supports Mac OS, FreeBSD and Windows.</paragraph>
