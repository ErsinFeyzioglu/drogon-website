Drogon can be used to easily build various types of web application server programs using C++.</p>\n<p><em>Drogon</em> is the name of a dragon in the American TV series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d that I really like.</p>\n<p>Drogon\u2019s main application platform is Linux. It also supports Mac OS, FreeBSD and Windows.</p>\n<p>Its main features are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Use a non-blocking I/O network lib based on epoll (kqueue under macOS/FreeBSD) to provide high-concurrency, high-performance network IO, please visit the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=composite\">TFB Tests Results</a>  for more details;</li>\n<li>Provide a completely asynchronous programming mode;</li>\n<li>Support Http1.0/1.1 (server side and client side);</li>\n<li>Based on template, a simple reflection mechanism is implemented to completely decouple the main program framework, controllers and views.</li>\n<li>Support cookies and built-in sessions;</li>\n<li>Support back-end rendering, the controller generates the data to the view to generate the Html page. Views are described by CSP template files, C++ codes are embedded into Html pages through CSP tags. And the drogon command-line tool automatically generates the C++ code files for compilation;</li>\n<li>Support view page dynamic loading (dynamic compilation and loading at runtime);</li>\n<li>Provide a convenient and flexible routing solution from the path to the controller handler;</li>\n<li>Support filter chains to facilitate the execution of unified logic (such as login verification, Http Method constraint verification, etc.) before handling HTTP requests;</li>\n<li>Support https (based on OpenSSL);</li>\n<li>Support WebSocket (server side and client side);</li>\n<li>Support JSON format request and response, very friendly to the Restful API application development;</li>\n<li>Support file download and upload;</li>\n<li>Support gzip, brotli compression transmission;</li>\n<li>Support pipelining;</li>\n<li>Provide a lightweight command line tool, drogon_ctl, to simplify the creation of various classes in Drogon and the generation of view code;</li>\n<li>Support non-blocking I/O based asynchronously reading and writing database (PostgreSQL and MySQL(MariaDB) database);</li>\n<li>Support asynchronously reading and writing sqlite3 database based on thread pool;</li>\n<li>Support ARM Architecture;</li>\n<li>Provide a convenient lightweight ORM implementation that supports for regular object-to-database bidirectional mapping;</li>\n<li>Support plugins which can be installed by the configuration file at load time;</li>\n<li>Support AOP with build-in joinpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n", "metatags": "", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["Installation-en", "Installation", "N", "next"], ["index-en", "English documentation", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "Overview-en.rstd.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Overview</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "display_toc": false, "page_source_suffix": ".rstd", "current_page_name": "Overview-en", "sidebars": ["localtoc.html", "relations.html", "sourcelink.html", "searchbox.html"], "customsidebar": null, "alabaster_version": "0.7.12"}
