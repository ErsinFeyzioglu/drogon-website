However, a good web framework should provide back-end rendering technology, so that the server program can dynamically generate HTML pages. Views can help users generate these pages. As the name implies, it is only responsible for doing the work related to the presentation, and the complex business logic should be handed over to the controller.</p>\n<p>The earliest web applications embed HTML into the program code to achieve the purpose of dynamically generating HTML pages, but this is inefficient, not intuitive, and so on. So there are languages such as JSP, which are the opposite. , embed the program code into the HTML page. The drogon is of course the latter solution. However, it is obvious that since C++ is compiled and executed, we need to convert the page embedded in C++ code into a C++ source program to compile into the application. Therefore, drogon defines its own specialized CSP (C++ Server Pages) description language, using the command line tool drogon_ctl to convert CSP files into C++ source files for compilation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"drogon-s-csp\">\n<h2>Drogon\u2019s CSP<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#drogon-s-csp\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Drogon\u2019s CSP solution is very simple, we use special markup symbols to embed C++ code into the HTML page. among them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>The content between the tags &lt;%inc and %&gt; is considered to be the part of the header file that needs to be referenced. Only the #include statement can be written here, such as &lt;%inc#include \u201cxx.h\u201d %&gt;, but many common header files are automatically included by drogon. The user basically does not use this tag;</li>\n<li>Everything between the tags &lt;%c++ and %&gt; is treated as C++ code, such as &lt;c++ std:string name=\u201ddrogon\u201d; %&gt;;</li>\n<li><dl class=\"first docutils\">\n<dt>C++ code is generally transferred to the target source file intact, except for the following two special tags:</dt>\n<dd><ul class=\"first last\">\n<li>&#64;&#64; represents the data variable passed by the controller, from which you can get the content you want to display;</li>\n<li>$$ represents a stream object representing the content of the page, and the content to be displayed can be displayed on the page by the &lt;&lt; operator;</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li>The content sandwiched between the tags [[ and ]] is considered to be the variable name. The view will use the name as the key to find the corresponding variable from the data passed from the controller and output it to the page. Spaces before and after the variable name will be omitted. Paired [[ and ]] should be on the same line. And for performance reasons, only three string data types are supported(const char *, std::string and const std::string), other data types should be output in the above-mentioned way(by $$);</li>\n<li>The content sandwiched between the tags {% and %} is considered to be the name of a variable or an expression of the C++ program (not the keyword of the data passed by the controller), and the view will output the contents of the variable or the value of the expression to the page. It\u2019s easy to know that {%val.xx%} is equivalent to &lt;%c++$$&lt;&lt;val.xx;%&gt;, but the former is simpler and more intuitive. Similarly, do not write two tags in separate lines;</li>\n<li>The content sandwiched between the tags &lt;%view and %&gt; is considered to be the name of the sub-view. The framework will find the corresponding sub-view and fill its contents to the location of the tag; the spaces before and after the view name will be ignored. Do not write &lt;%view and %&gt; in separate lines. Can use multiple levels of nesting, but not loop nesting;</li>\n<li>The content between the tags &lt;%layout and %&gt; is considered as the name of the layout. The framework will find the corresponding layout and fill the content of this view to a position in the layout (in the layout the placeholder [[]] marks this position); spaces before and after the layout name will be ignored, and &lt;%layout and %&gt; should not be written in separate lines. You can use multiple levels of nesting, but not loop nesting. One template file can only inherit from one base layout, multiple inheritance from different layouts is not supported.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-use-of-views\">\n<h2>The use of views<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-use-of-views\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The http response of the drogon application is generated by the controller handler, so the response rendered by the view is also generated by the handler, generated by calling the following interface:</p>\n<p>This interface is a static method of the HttpResponse class, which has two parameters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>viewName: the name of the view, the name of the incoming csp file (<em>the extension can be omitted</em>);</li>\n<li>data: The controller\u2019s handler passes the data to the view.
