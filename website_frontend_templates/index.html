  <h1>Drogon: a C++14/17-based HTTP application framework</h1>
  <!--*********************************************************************-->

  <p>Drogon can be used to easily build various types of web application server programs using C++,
    a cross-platform framework, It supports Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Windows. Its main features are as follows:
    <!--<a href="#">LLVM</a> -->
  </p>

  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2 id="goals">Features and Goals</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->

  <p>Some of the goals for the project include the following:</p>

  <p><b><a href="features.html#enduser">End-User Features</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Use a non-blocking I/O network lib based on epoll (kqueue under macOS/FreeBSD) to provide high-concurrency, high-performance network IO, please visit the <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=composite" title="TFB Tests Results">TFB Tests Results</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>Provide a completely asynchronous programming mode.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <p><b><a href="features.html#applications">Utility and
     Applications</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Support Http1.0/1.1 (server side and client side).</li>
  <li>Provide a completely asynchronous programming mode.</li>
  <li>Provide a convenient and flexible routing solution from the path to the controller handler.</li>
  <li>Provide a lightweight command line tool, drogon_ctl, to simplify the creation of various classes in Drogon and the generation of view code/</li>
  <li>Provide a convenient lightweight ORM implementation that supports for regular object-to-database bidirectional mapping.</li>
  <li>Use the 'MIT' License</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b><a href="features.html#design">Internal Design and
     Implementation</a></b>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Based on template, a simple reflection mechanism is implemented to completely decouple the main program framework, controllers and views.</li>
  <li>Support cookies and built-in sessions.</li>
  <li>Support back-end rendering, the controller generates the data to the view to generate the Html page. Views are described by CSP template files, C++ codes are embedded into Html pages through CSP tags. And the drogon command-line tool automatically generates the C++ code files for compilation.</li>
  <li>Support view page dynamic loading (dynamic compilation and loading at runtime).</li>
  <li>Support filter chains to facilitate the execution of unified logic (such as login verification, Http Method constraint verification, etc.) before handling HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>Support https (based on OpenSSL).</li>
  <li>Support WebSocket (server side and client side).</li>
  <li>Support JSON format request and response, very friendly to the Restful API application development.</li>
  <li>Support file download and upload.</li>
  <li>Support gzip, brotli compression transmission.</li>
  <li>Support pipelining.</li>
  <li>Support non-blocking I/O based asynchronously reading and writing database (PostgreSQL and MySQL(MariaDB) database).</li>
  <li>Support asynchronously reading and writing sqlite3 database based on thread pool.</li>
  <li>Support ARM Architecture.</li>
  <li>Support plugins which can be installed by the configuration file at load time.</li>
  <li>Support AOP with build-in joinpoints.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of
     Drogon.  To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the <a
     href="#">Features</a> section, which breaks
     each of these down and explains them in more detail.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->

  <p>Drogon is the name of a dragon in the American TV series "Game of Thrones" that I really like.Building various types of web application server programs using C++ seems like difficulty.Drogon aims at easiness.</p>

  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2>Current Status</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->

  <p>As example, Drogon is used in production to build
   back-end software like SpringBoot ,ThinkPhp and Ruby on Rail .<br />  If you are looking
   for high-concurrency and high-performance network IO web framkework, Drogon is probably
   a great solution for you.  Drogon supports C++11, C++14 and C++17, please see
   the <a href="related.html">Documents</a> page for more information.</p>

  <!--=====================================================================-->
  <h2>Get it and get involved!</h2>
  <!--=====================================================================-->

  <p>Start by <a href="https://github.com/an-tao/drogon">cloning with git, building it, and
     playing with it</a>.  This will show you the sorts of things we can do
     today and will let you have the "Drogon experience" first hand: hopefully
     it will "resonate" with you. :)</p>

  <p>Once you've done that, please consider <a href="#">getting
     involved in the Drogon community</a>.  The Drogon developers include numerous
     volunteer contributors with a variety of backgrounds.  If you're
     interested in
     following the development of Drogon, signing up for a mailing list is a good
     way to learn about how the project works.</p>
